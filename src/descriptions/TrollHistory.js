        		Led at that time by Vol’jin’s wise father, Sen’jin, the Darkspears abandoned their prejudices and bravely fought side by side with the Horde to defeat a group of humans encroaching on their jungle isle. However, the Darkspears were soon driven from the island by a frenzied band of murlocs intent on appeasing a mysterious sea witch. In the frenzy, Sen’jin was slain.

In Sen’jin’s honor, Thrall welcomed the Darkspears into the Horde and gave them a new home along the coastline of Durotar; the Echo Isles. But misfortune struck again; the witch doctor Zalazane betrayed his fellow tribespeople, enslaving them as mindless servants and forcing the Darkspears to fight for their new home.  Following the Horde’s victory against the Lich King in Northrend, Vol’jin allied with the ancestral loa—powerful spirits worshipped by the trolls—and secured victory over the Echo Isles.

When the brash orc Garrosh was named warchief and openly showed his disdain for the Darkspear, many disillusioned trolls abandoned the Horde capital, Orgrimmar. Garrosh’s betrayals and crimes against the other Horde races led to his deposition at the hands of Thrall, who named Vol’jin as the new warchief. Since then, the trolls’ deserved place within the Horde has only strengthened, and they stand ready to face anything that might threaten it.
